# Election-Analysis
This Project is tasked with assisting a Colorado Board of Elections employee Tom in an election audit of the tabulated results for U.S Congressional Precint in Colorado. The aim is to provide the following
- The total number of Votes cast
- The total number of votes for each candidate
- The percentage of votes for each candidate
- The winner of the election based on the most popular vote

Tom's manager wants to if there is a way to automate the process using Python. If this audit is done successfully with Python, the code will be used to audit not only other congressional districts but also senatorial districts and local elections. 
There are three primary voting methods that will be taken into account: Mail-in ballots, punch cards, and direct recording electronic or DRE counting machines. Mail-in ballots are typically hand counted at the central office. Punch cards are collected and then fed into a machine that tabulates vote totals and sends the results to the central office. Finally memory cards from DRE
counting machines are sent to the central office and read by a computer. All together, the vote cast by these three methods will determine the final election results. A vote count reported will be generated after all votes are counted
